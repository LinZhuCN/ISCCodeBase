Utility.XML2JSONUtil is an utility method to transfer an xml into json without schema
/// Known limitations:
/// 1. Can not handle XML attributes yes since the json representation of them are json nodes, which is ambiguous to those of xml properties
/// 2. Array or List XML nodes can be ambiguous to xml properties when there is only one member in the array/list.
/// Since without schema, when there is only one child node in the xml, we can not decide whether it is a single node or a member of an array/list

Example XML:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <animals>
        <dog>
            <name>Rufus</name>
            <breed>labrador</breed>
        </dog>
        <dog>
            <name>Marty</name>
            <breed>whippet</breed>
        </dog>
	<dog>
